# DN-Tools
Repository for DN-Tools for DN People. 

## Overview For DN 

## Development Process

### Git and GitHub
The development process will use GitHub (and Git) for Project Management, Issue/Bug Management , Wiki, CI/CD and of course Source Control. 
This means no Jira, no Confluence, no Bitbucket. GitHub is feature rich and those features will be utilized.  There should be no reason to step outside Git/GitHub. 

The focus will be in social coding - or InnerSource. Anyone within DN can contribute to these projects.
